In this assignment we are required to design a number formatting converter and calculator.

Firstly, this will be done by asking the user to choose a number from base 2 to 16, when 10-16 are represented correspondently by A-G, using the following format: .

for example, valid numbers include: 1011b2, 175bA (= 135, the base is decimal), 012b5, 123bG and so on. if the number chosen is not valid, d for example: “b2”, “0b1”, “123b”, “1234b11”, “3b3”, “-3b5”, “3 b4”, “GbG” the output will show an error and ask the user to enter a new number.

Secondly, once a valid number is entered, the output will show that it is a true number as well as its convereted decimal value.

Afterwards, the output will ask the user to choose a second number similarly to the first one. When the second valid number is chosen, the output will ask the user to choose a base from 2 to 16,
